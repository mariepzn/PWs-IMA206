# Practical Works – Computational Photography

This repository collects two practical works (PWs) carried out in the context of the **Computational Photography** course at Telecom Paris. Each practical explores a deep learning–based generative model applied to image data.

## Contents

### PW1 – Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders
Implements convolutional autoencoders to learn compact latent representations of MNIST digits. The work extends to **variational autoencoders (VAE)** for probabilistic modeling and image generation, including comparisons with naïve Gaussian sampling in the latent space.

### PW2 – Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) with WGAN-GP Loss
Builds a **Deep Convolutional GAN** (DCGAN) to generate MNIST digits, trained with the Wasserstein GAN objective and gradient penalty (WGAN-GP). The practical includes generator/discriminator architectures, training stability improvements, and exploratory experiments such as latent space interpolation.
